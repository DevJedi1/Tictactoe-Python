# Tictactoe-Python

*In this project, I built a simple tic-tac-toe game using Python. 

*In my project, you (X) play against a not-so-intelligent AI (O).

* The game is very simple and may not look too good, but it works.

* If you intend to run the game, it may not work in the normal terminal, you may need to use the debug terminal in order to run the game. *
